- 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel Desmond
- 👀 I’m interested in Server-Side web development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use Nodejs for back end development and working on multiple projects with it
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some front end develpment because I'm not to great at it and would love if someone could help me to design my front ends
- 📫 You can email me at df.dezmond9@gmail.com or you can call/text me at (302)803-2547

I am currently in high school and only began learning to program in late July of 2020. Since then I have been learning web development working with Reactjs for my
front end and using Nodejs with Expressjs for my back end. I also have learned some Python for side projects. I am always looking to learn more and feel free to 
reach out to me with any questions.

Languages I know include:
* Javascript
* Python
* Java
* Haskell
* HTML5
* CSS3
